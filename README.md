# simulate-hello-key
have you ever been tired of pressing hello , no well here is  the code anyway for people to under stand simulated key presses


#hey dude go to cmd and use the command "pip install pynput"
#if unable to search how to download pip in google 

any way pynput.keyboard import Key, Controller , dont asume your gonna get a explainasion for that 
cuse your not

keyboard = controler()
is just to set up the code stuff

next is a = 2

i just made that to make the code longer lol

okay next is the if command its basicly

if this a(the variable) is 2
then

run the code of

keyboard.press("h") it is used to simulated the key press in english terms HEY PRESS THE FRICKING BUTTON THAT THE USER GAVE YOU


to make it look like your typing then 

use the code 

import time 

and then put

time.sleep(0.5) between the code like

from pynput.keyboard import Key, Controller
import time 

keyboard = Controller()


a  = 2

if a == 2:    
    keyboard.press("h")
    time.sleep(0.5)
    keyboard.press("e")
    time.sleep(0.5)
    keyboard.press("l")
   time.sleep(0.5)
    keyboard.press("l")
    time.sleep(0.5)
    keyboard.press("o")
    
    just copy the code from the main py file and put time.sleep(0.5)
 if you cant see the code or the code didnt work
